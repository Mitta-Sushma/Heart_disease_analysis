❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard & Web Application:

📌 Abstract
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Understanding its risk factors is essential for early detection and prevention.
The Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard & Web Application is developed using Tableau, Flask, and SQL to analyze and visualize cardiovascular risk factors. The system presents insights through interactive dashboards and stores user data using a database for better management.

📖 Introduction
The growing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases highlights the need for accessible tools that analyze health data and present insights clearly.
This project enables users to explore heart disease risk factors through interactive visualizations and a web interface. It demonstrates how demographic, lifestyle, and medical attributes influence heart disease.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze heart disease risk factors using data visualization
Store and manage user data using SQL database
Identify high-risk groups through dashboards
Integrate Tableau dashboards into a Flask web app
Promote awareness of heart disease prevention

📌 Scope of the Project
This project is suitable for:
Academic submissions
Data visualization learning
Flask and SQL integration practice
Healthcare analytics demonstrations


🏗️ System Architecture
The system follows a client–server architecture:
Frontend
HTML, CSS
Embedded Tableau dashboard
Backend
Python Flask for routing and logic
Database
SQL (SQLite/MySQL) for storing user data
Visualization Layer
